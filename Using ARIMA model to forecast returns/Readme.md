# Using ARIMA model to forecast returns
This folder contains a detailed theoretical and practical introduction to time series analysis models such as AutoRegressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA).
We use Python's library statsmodels to implement all models above and use the ARIMA model to forecast future stock prices.
